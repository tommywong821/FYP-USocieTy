This project aims to develop a web and cross-platform mobile application that centralizes the promotion and registration of all student events at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The current methods of event promotion and management, such as social media, posters, and manual sign-up forms, are inefficient and tedious for both students and society administrators. The proposed application provides an all-in-one platform for students to browse and enroll in events, manage their schedules, and search for venues. Society administrators can use the platform to efficiently promote their events and manage membership and enrollment. Additionally, they can manage and visualize their financial record by different charts. The platform also provides an attendance-checking system that can read students’ unique user IDs from their student cards via an RFID reader. To ensure security, the platform provides user authentication via HKUST ITSC’s Central Authentication Server (CAS). By addressing the pain points of event promotion and management, this project aims to enhance the overall campus experience at HKUST and benefit both students and society administrators.
